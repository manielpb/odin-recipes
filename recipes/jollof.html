         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <p>If you don't have a Dutch oven, this dish can be made in a stovetop pot,then transferred to a deep oven-safe dish for baking</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Blend aromatics and crushed tomato: in a blender, combine onion, scotch bonnet, ginger, bell peppers and garlic with crushed tomato. Blend until smooth, and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a Dutch oven over medium heat, add vegetable oil, sliced Spanish onion and bay leaves (if using). Stir with a wooden spoon for 10 minutes on medium heat until onions begin to lightly brown and soften.</li>
            <li>Add tomato paste and fry for 5 minutes, stirring frequently to make sure it doesn’t burn.</li>
            <li>Add chopped tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring constantly so it does not burn. Mash them lightly with the back of your wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Add all seasoning: paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, curry powder, plus bouillon cube and pinch of nutmeg if using, and mix well.</li>
            <li>Simmer over low heat, stirring periodically until there is a layer of oil over the tomato stew.</li>
            <li>Add the prepared smooth blended aromatics and crushed tomatoes to the Dutch oven.</li>
            <li>Cover partially and simmer over low, stirring constantly for 30-40 minutes. Stirring every 2 minutes or so is important because near the end of the 30 minutes, tomato stew can burn easily. You want the oil to separate from the stew yet again. Ghanaians cook their stews for a very long time when making jollof to get the best results.</li>
            <li>Near the end of cooking, wash Jasmine rice by rinsing it with water and pouring it off the water, repeat until the water runs nearly clear, this may take up to 4 rinses and pours.</li>
            <li>After oil has resurfaced on the stew and the stew has reduced in volume and darkened slightly, taste and add salt to taste.</li>
            <li>Add washed Jasmine rice after seasoning. Mix rice into stew thoroughly until all of the rice is coated.</li>
            <li>Add 2 ½ cups of water, or until it’s about ½ cm above the rice (be sure not to add any more or the rice will get mushy). Taste and add more salt if necessary. The water-stew-rice mixture should be well seasoned or the jollof rice might be under seasoned.</li>
            <li>Cover Dutch oven with tin foil, place the tin foil so that it is touching the rice, then place lid over it.</li>
            <li>Place in the oven and bake for 1 hour 15 minutes at 325°F.</li>
            <li>After 1 hour 15 minutes, check doneness of rice – it should be well cooked but not mushy. If undercooked, add up to ¼-½ cup of water depending on how hard the rice is, cover tightly with tin foil and bake for an additional 20 minutes. If the rice is overcooked, bake uncovered for about 15 minutes to dry out.</li>
            <li>Once rice is cooked to your preference, serve with your favourite protein and sides.</li>
